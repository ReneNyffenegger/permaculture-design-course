The emotion inventory is a reference (with parenthetically similar
emotions) for checking-in about group, organization, and individual
requirements.

Feeling is one of three attributes associated with each requirement:
place, skill, and feeling.

Part of the requirements gathering is to check-in with yourself
about each requirement.  A check-in is not judgemental: you
experience all of these emotions and as such they should be
represented in your environment roughly in the proportion you
experience them.  They are a sensemaking tool.
