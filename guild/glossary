guild
-----

A guild is a harmonious assembly of species clustered around a
central element (plant or animal).  This assembly acts in relation to
the element to assist its health, aid our work in management, or
buffer adverse environmental effects (see Figure 3.12).

(From Permaculture: A Designer's Manual)

A guild is a group of plants and animals harmoniously interwoven
into a pattern of mutual support, often centered around one major
species, that benefits humans while creating habitat.

(From Gaia's Garden, pg. 183)
