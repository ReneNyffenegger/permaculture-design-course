Reasons to place species in association:
  To benefit a selected species by
   + roducing root competition
	 + assissting pest control
			- anti-feedants
			- killing root parasits or predators
			- hosting predators
	To assist gathering
	 + culinary associates

attributes:
  + size
		 If a plant is large, fewer, small, more.
		 (Metabolic theory of ecology)
  + suppression: of predators or other plants.
		 through shade, odor,
	+ attraction: of beneficial insects
	+ mulch (is this more than nitrogen fixation?)
	+ nutrient accumulation (how does this differ from mulch?) 

attributes (Gaia's Garden)
  + grass suppressers
	+ insect/bird attractors
	+ nutrient accumulators
	+ mulch plants
	+ nitrogen fixers
	+ soil fumigants
	+ pest repellents

ecological functions:
  + air purifier
	+ animal forage
	+ erosion control
	+ fire retardant
	+ flood management
	+ fortrees/barrier
	+ insectary
	+ mulch maker
	+ nitrogen fixer
	+ nitrogen scavenger
	+ nurse/scaffold/chaperone
	+ nutrient accumulator
	+ pest repellent
	+ soil builder
	+ soil cultivator/spikeroot
	+ toxin absorption
	+ water purification
	+ wildlife food
	+ wildlife habitat
	+ windbreak

human use
  + aromatic/fragrance
	+ basketry and weaving
	+ cleaser/scourer
	+ compost
	+ cut flower
	+ dried flower
	+ dye
	+ essential oil
	+ fiber
	+ food
	+ insect repellent
	+ medicine
	+ oil, wax, resin, or polish
	+ soap
	+ wood

These are actually the basic needs of the central element: unit
analysis now comes into play, w00t. 
 Both of these are going to be foundational in any guild:
  + nutrient accumulation
  + mulch

As well, we could define a "primary function" like attracting birds
or pollinators.
