 - corn
 - beans
 - squash
 - rocky mountain bee plant [to push the pattern]

beans draw nitrogen from the air
 + habit: vine
 + requires: trellis
 + provides: nitrogen (what is this process?)
constalk forms a trellist for the bean vines to climb
 + provides: trellis
squash covers the ground
 + shades soil: provided by habit
	 This prevents water loss, supresses weeds (which need sunlight)

assertion: more food with less water and fertilizer than a similar
area planted to any one of these three crops in isolation.

alone

This is good, it reduces the limited resources through conversion
or importation.
