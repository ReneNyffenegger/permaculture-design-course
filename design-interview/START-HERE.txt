"What do you want for the rat's life?"

The coyote looked menacing--as menacing as his hungry eyes would make
him.  He stared the distance between himself and the turtle, casting
furtive glances at the packrat peering squished out from under the
turtle's shell.

"Hello dear coyote.  My name is cakyrespa. This packrat here is my
friend.  Her name is ratcu.  Will you tell us your name?"

Coyote sat down in the assumption of a peaceful demeanor.  So quickly
he didn't know he had done so before saying "Forgive my haste patient
cakyrespa.  My name is ko'otli.  ratcu and I were playing a game, and I
got carried away."

Interrupting from the branches of the cottonwood tree above them, owl
announced her presence.  "I do not think, wise cakyrespa, that you will
resolve this conflict."

"You did not alight upon that tree to tell me that, glauka."
cakyrespa did not take his eyes off ko'otli.

"Another human is ready to talk.  I've called a moot."  glauka didn't need
to wait for a reply.

--

The full moon illuminated the small hill.  glauka sat on a branch
a few feet off the ground, with ratcu the rat to his left, cakyrespa
the turtle before him, and ko'otli the coyote to his right, eyeing
ratcu.

glauka spoke.  "We have a new project.  A small property that the
owner has asked our help in making a place for the more-than-human
world.  I call this moot to discuss and make sense of our needs.
The sum of our needs will, as always, exceed the capacity of this
project.  We can and will, through this process, find our world
better through what we express with this project."

"Let's check-in.  I'm happy for a new opportunity with this land.
I'm afraid of this process.  I'm in."

"Welcome, glauka."  They all spoke in unison.

ratcu spoke.  "I'm happy because I'm exploring, I'm angry because I
was about to be someone's dinner.  I'm in."  For the first time ratcu
returned coyote's gaze.  He was safe in this circle.

"Welcome ratcu."  Again in unison.

In turn, cakyrespa spoke.  "I'm angry that this process will involve
compromising on our collective needs.  I'm sad everyone will not get
what they want.  I'm afraid we won't find the correct balance.  I'm
in."

"Welcome cakyrespa."

coyote spoke.  "I'm sad I went without dinner.  I'm afraid there
won't be room for my own needs in this process.  I'm in."

"Welcome ko'otli."

glauka began.  "Though we have all done this process before, I
will as always start at the beginning."

"To bring this land back into the more-than-human world, we must show
the human inhabitant that we will make room for her.  This we do by
preparing a Simple Critical Infrastructure Map for the site.  cakyrespa,
please describe SCIM."

cakyrespa describes SCIM to the assembled animals.  For your reference,
please find that description attached in the file:

  simple-critical-infrastructure-map

glauka continues "For this moot we will collect the information we
need to prepare the simple, critical infrastructure map.  We will
actually prepare two maps, one showing the current infrastructure
and one showing the infrastructure as we would like it.  The
difference between these two will be our work."

Creating these maps will be done by filling out select inventories
and templates.  This should be done as you read by following the
guides present in the text.


Skill Inventory
===============

  ratcu asks, "What can she do?"
  cakyrespa responds.  "That question needs to be more specific."

A skill inventory is your embodied knowledge.  We'll focus primarily
on basic skills: those that are keeping you alive.

1)  [Use the file skill-inventory to record your answer this question.]

    What skills do you possess and/or what training have you had to prevent
    each of the six ways to die?  Note that this is not access to
    infrastructure or supply lines, but things like First Aid or the
    ability to cook.  List only the skills you actively practice.
      + too hot (e.g., first aid)
      + too cold (e.g., sewing)
      + hunger: (e.g., cooking)
      + thirst: (e.g., water purification)
      + illness (e.g., NM Environment Department license)
      + injury (e.g., self-defense training)
      + additional skills


Skill Gap
=========

  "That isn't much to work with." claims ko'otli.
  "It's enough to see past your tricks one more day, ko'otli." retorts
  ratcu.
  cakyrespa says, "Leave her room to respond herself, ratcu"

When you are missing a basic skill it is called a resilience gap.
Because you are still alive, That skill is being provided for you by a
group or organization above you.  having a resilience gap is
fine: this is a problem to understand, rather than fix.

2)  [Use the file skill-gap to record your answer this question.]

    If you are interested in closing your resilience gap, what skills
    and/or training would you like have to prevent each of the six ways
    to die?
      + too hot
      + too cold
      + hunger
      + thirst
      + illness
      + injury
      + additional skills


Place Inventory
===============

  The meeting was suddenly interrupted: A roadrunner leapt to a
  nearby boulder, it's wings spread open to a glide.  glauka recognized
  bajycpi, the scout: "Welcome bajycpi, I am glad you are in attendance."

  bajycpi replied.  "I'm angry I'm late, and happy with the news
  I bring.  I have fully explored the property, even avoiding a
  potentially disagreeable and fortunately sleeping dog."

  bajycpi delivered his report to the moot.  You will find it attached as
	the file place-inventory.  Add your own knowledge to the report provided
	by bajycpi by answering the question below.

3)  [Please use the file place-inventory to record your answer to this
     question.]

    Please list all distinct "places" on the property.  Places include
    structures (e.g., house, garage, shed), areas reserved for specific use
    (e.g., driveway, garden, path), and null or dead spaces that emerge
    from answering this question.  A place is different from a use:
    one place may see many uses.  Every square foot of property has
    one and only one place.


Present
=======

  "There are 2 dimensions we will use to explore this topic.  Time
	and social hierarchy."  said glauka.  We will first discuss
	the present, discussing both groups and organizations.  After
	establishing where we are, we will discuss the future."

The following questions deal with the present.  When answering them,
remember to state strictly what is happening now.  There will ample
opportunity to discuss future plans: whether those plans occur next
week or years from now.  When discussing the present, be a neutral
observer and describe the situation as it actually is.  The wished
for is the path that begins here.


Groups
------

  "I'm still not sure I understand what a group is." says ratcu. 
  "They're trouble." answers ko'otli.

9)  Which (if any) basic requirements listed in question #5 would be
    better provided elsewhere?  Which uses are obsolete and should go
    away?

  "That was not bad." said ratcu.  "Indeed, excellent work." said
  cakyrespa.  "Are we done?" asked ratcu.  "No." replied cakyrespa.
  "Because I have not yet eaten." said ko'otli.


Organizations
-------------

  "I see how my Trading Party can be considered a group, but what is
  an organization?" asked ratcu.

  "An organization is like the rancher and I cooperating to raise
  chickens that I can eat." said ko'otli.

  "glauka and I have provided an example you can follow along with."
  said cakyrespa.  "We decided to document this moot.  Find it in:"

Individual
==========

  "With all of these obligations, what if I wish to merely
  experience the act of running in the world?" asked bajycpi.

  of one's life.  That improvised performance is sacred, and
  we leave it last so it can be seen without the burden of
  justification required by obligation."

26) [Please use the file individual-requirements to record
     your answers to this question.  Please reference the
     files place-inventory, skill-inventory, skill-gap and

    As an individual, what additional needs do you have for the
    property?  Just like Groups and Organizations, fill out your
    current and future needs, making sure to record the place,
    skill, and emotion associated with each requirement.

    organizations you had not previously thought of.  For example,
    if you need Internet access for communication as part of a
    professional organization, consider filling out an
    organizations-requirements-template file for that organization
    and describing the services the property provides to it, even
    if those services are provided exclusively for your participation.

  glauka said, in closing, "I thank all of you for attending, and for
  the honor of facilitating this discussion.  Merry meet..."

  "merry part, and merry meet again." they said in unison.
