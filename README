This is a needs assessment for my permaculture design project: the final
exam for the permaculture design course I'm taking.

The format for my course is 7 weekends, rather than the 2 week
intensive.

 * Plutchik's Wheel of Emotion

The characters presented here I originally developed playing "Where
are your Keys?" WAYK (http://www.whereareyourkeys.org/)  They are all
named after the Lojban word describing them, as my work with WAYK
is all related to Lojban: http://lodockikumazvati.org/
